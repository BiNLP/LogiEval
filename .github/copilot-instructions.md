# Copilot Instructions for LogiEval

This is a Python project for evaluating large language models on logical reasoning datasets. When working on this project:

1. **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 conventions and use type hints where appropriate
2. **Performance**: Prioritize efficiency and minimize unnecessary computations
3. **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling for dataset loading and model inference
4. **Documentation**: Write clear docstrings and comments for complex logic
5. **Testing**: Consider edge cases and validate inputs/outputs
6. **Dependencies**: Use the specified versions in requirements.txt and minimize external dependencies
7. **Configuration**: Make components configurable and extensible
8. **Memory Management**: Be mindful of memory usage when working with large models and datasets
